 * This class finds the given reward for each action-state pair based on the following rules defined:
 *   - Every reward is -0.04 (step cost) with the following exceptions:
 *      1) If the agent is already in the square marked -1, and takes an action that lands it back in that square, the 
 *      reward is 0.0.
 *      2) If the agent is not already in the sqaure marked -1, but takes an action that lands it in that square, the 
 *      reward is -1.0.
 *      3) If the agent is already in the square marked +1, and takes an action that lands it back in that square, the 
 *      reward is 0.0.
 *      4) If the agent is not already in the square marked +1, but takes an action that ladns it in that square, and the agent 
 *      has a key, the reward is +1.0. 
 * The main class uses this reward array created in the different solution techniques.
